# Gradient_Background

A gradient background is a design technique that blends multiple colors together in a smooth transition. Gradients can be used to create multi-color backgrounds or custom buttons. They can add visual interest to a UI and guide user attention. 
Gradient backgrounds were introduced in CSS3. CSS allows you to set the color, shape, and transparency of the gradient. 
You can also give the gradient a specific angle. For example, 0deg creates a vertical gradient running bottom to top, and 90deg creates a horizontal gradient running left to right. 
Gradients can be used in apps and websites to make them look more attractive. For example, the Instagram logo uses a gradient. 
You can create a gradient background in: CSS, React Native, Android.
